# Attention Is All You Need

https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/03/30/transformers/

This is a seminal paper. It has dominated the field of NLP.

The paper proposes the *Transformer* network architecture for seq2seq tasks,
which outperforms RNNs and CNNs (convs=over time, so can be for non-image based
data).  It uses several attention mechanisms and replicated layers (with skip
connections).

Fortunately, Google's implementation is open source so I'll just use that if I
need it. That's probably the easiest way to get up to speed on it.

Update: after reviewing it, I feel like I get the gist of it. Very cool.
