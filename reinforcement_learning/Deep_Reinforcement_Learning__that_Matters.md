# Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters

Ah, I thought I had a paper summary for this, but I guess it went away ...

This paper is a much needed dose of sanity for our field, showing that while
DeepRL is extremely popular, there is high variability in algorithms, and some
results are not statistically significant (if we can even agree on what that
means).

I think for any future paper, cite this when I want to explain why I chose some
methodology the way I did. It also makes it clear to reviewers that I am aware
of issues like this plaguing our field.
